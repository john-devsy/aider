# This is a test comment added as per the GitHub issue request

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This change reflects a basic Python script where I've inserted a comment at the top of the `main.py` file, addressing the GitHub issue's request to insert a comment in a popular file. If there were specific files or languages, additional context would help tailor the changes appropriately.
